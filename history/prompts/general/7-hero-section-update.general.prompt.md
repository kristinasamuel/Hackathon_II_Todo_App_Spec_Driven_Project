## Response Summary
Successfully updated the hero section layout as requested:

1. **Single Color Background**: Modified the hero section to have a unified gradient background (from-teal-50 to-cyan-100) instead of having different gradients for left and right sides.

2. **Right Side Content Preserved**: Kept the right side content intact with the task management illustration and card design.

3. **Features Section Heading**: Updated the features section with a large, prominent heading using 4xl to 5xl font size for better visibility.

4. **Layout Organization**: Cleaned up the layout structure to ensure consistent styling throughout the hero section.

The changes resulted in a more cohesive and visually appealing landing page with a unified background color scheme while maintaining all functional elements.
